# README

You can download these exercises to go along with our Bootstrap tutorials on [Simple Dev](https://simpledev.io/). You donâ€™t have to know how to use GitHub to use them.

Currently, the `index.html` files are all using Bootstrap 4. However, you can swap out the CDN links if you'd like to try Bootstrap 5.

## Instructions
